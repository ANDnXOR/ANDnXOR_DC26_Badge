For convenience, drivers for the USB to Serial IC we used are contained here. In the event you do trust us, this will save you some time downloading drivers yourself.

If you don't trust us, you shouldn't, download the CP2102N drivers from silabs.


For Linux, drivers are included. Just need appropriate permissions on the /dev/tty* device and a udev rule. See: https://www.silabs.com/community/interface/knowledge-base.entry.html/2016/06/06/fixed_tty_deviceass-XzTf
