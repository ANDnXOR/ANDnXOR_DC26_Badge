HAI DC26
WELCOME TO THE AND!XOR UNOFFICIAL DEFCON 26 BADGE!

This is our third year, thanks to everyone helping make this happen. 

SCREENSHOTS

Screenshots can be taken by holding the LEFT and RIGHT buttons under the screen.
These will be saved in the root directory. To convert the .raw files to .png
use the following command:

ffmpeg -vcodec rawvideo -f rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb565be -s 220x176 -i screenshot-24534.raw -f image2 -vcodec png image.png


LULZCODE

That's right, we made our own interpreter: LULZCODE an extension of LOLCODE.
LULZCODE files are stored in the root directory. All LOLCODE features are 
supported _except unicode_, sorry just couldn't make it fit. Check out our code,
please, Zapp spent 9 months trolling himself with it. Modify it, break some 
things, show off your work.

KTHXBYE
