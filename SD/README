HAI DC26
WELCOME TO THE AND!XOR UNOFFICIAL DEFCON 26 BADGE!

This is our third year, thanks to everyone helping make this happen. 

BLING

We're back with raw RGB565 files for bling. This lets us push more FPS for 
ultimate blast processing. Use the following command to convert just about
any video or gif file to raw.

Generate Raw File:

ffmpeg -i <INPUT.GIF> -y -loglevel error -vf "scale=220:176:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=220:176:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"  -r 11 -f rawvideo -s 220x176 -pix_fmt rgb565be <OUTPUT.RAW>

Generate Raw Preview

ffmpeg -i <INPUT.GIF> -frames 1 -vframes 1 -f image2 -s 220x176 -pix_fmt rgb565be <OUTPUT>.raw
mv <OUTPUT>.raw <OUTPUT>.preview



SCREENSHOTS

Screenshots can be taken by holding the LEFT and RIGHT buttons under the screen.
These will be saved in the root directory as BMP files. 


LULZCODE

That's right, we made our own interpreter: LULZCODE an extension of LOLCODE.
LULZCODE files are stored in the root directory. All LOLCODE features are 
supported _except unicode_, sorry just couldn't make it fit. Check out our code,
please, Zapp spent 9 months trolling himself with it. Modify it, break some 
things, show off your work.

KTHXBYE
