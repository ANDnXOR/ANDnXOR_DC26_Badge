# AND!XOR DC26 Indie Badge

All files related to the badge are posted here. For now we are only releasing the SD card image as well as any updates to the .bin file (for updates to the core badge itself).

To create a new SD card, format the card with FAT32 then copy the contents of SD/ to the SD card.

*Note: due to the large size of some files, git lfs is required: https://git-lfs.github.com/ *

# LULZCODE Support for Atom Editor #

LULZCODE is supported by Atom using our plugin: https://atom.io/packages/atom-lulzcode

It is only tested to work on Linux as Windows does not play well with YMODEM from the commandline. At AND!XOR we've been using Linux as our daily-driver since the year of the Linux Desktop anyways. And so should you.
