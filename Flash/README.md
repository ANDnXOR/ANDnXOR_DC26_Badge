# Flashing #

Use flash.sh to manuall flash the bootloader, boot_stub, and firmware to an AND!XOR badge. 

Note this requires esptool to be installed which is available in Ubuntu 18.04.

```
sudo apt-get install esptool
```

Alternatively, esptool.py can be installed with

```
pip install esptool
```

However, the flash script will need to be modified accordingly.
